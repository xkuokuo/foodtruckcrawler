Together they seemed to be a perfect fit for one of our newest mobile food concepts. Chicken \u0026 Rice is a signature dish around the globe. GaiBox nods to Nong’s Khao Man Gai in Portland, Oregon. Every time we head south to visit our sister city, we have to eat some of her delicious Thai heritage.\nOur story is less about homage and more about giving you a yearlong simple and craveable experience. Our locally sourced chicken is poached whole with fragrant herbs and spices, and the rice is cooked using the broth. Simply delicious.
